# Cloud Minecraft Setup (GitHub Codespaces)

## üõë Before You Start Assuming, Read This:
I know you're probably thinking, *"This is affiliated with Eaglercraft or something similar. It's playing Minecraft in a browser, and we all know how Eaglercraft got DMCA'd because it distributed Minecraft source code, pirated it, etc."*  
**IT'S NOT.**

This setup does not involve distributing Minecraft source code or pirating the game. It‚Äôs entirely different. Read on to understand how it works.

---

## ‚ùì How This Works
1. A **virtual desktop environment** is created by emulating a screen.
2. The **official Minecraft Launcher** is downloaded and installed.
3. **Java Runtime Environment 17** (JRE 17) is installed to run Minecraft.
4. **Streaming tools** (VNC + noVNC) are used to provide access to Minecraft through a browser.

## ‚úÖ Is This Legal?
**Yes.**  
- This setup does not modify the game in any way.
- The Minecraft Launcher and files are downloaded directly from Mojang's official servers.
- The only potential legal issue would be using a **local (offline) account**, which bypasses Minecraft's authentication system. That‚Äôs entirely your choice, and **I‚Äôm not responsible** for that.

## üîß Is This Feasible?
Yes! If you‚Äôve used any cloud gaming service like **Xbox Cloud Gaming**, **now.gg**, or **GeForce Now**, the concept here is similar.  
GitHub Codespaces offers **4 cores**, which is more than enough to run Minecraft Java Edition in a cloud environment.
